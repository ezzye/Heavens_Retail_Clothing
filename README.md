## Heavens Retail Clothing

Responsive website for a clothing retailer.


# Installation

Build your project for the first time:

`npm install`
`bower install`
`gulp build`

`npm run update-webdriver`


To run live app:
in `www` directory
`nhttp-server -a localhost -p 8000`

To run unit tests:
`npm test`


To run e2e test:
`protractor src/e2e-tests/protractor.conf.js`



# Approach

 1 Use Mobile Angular UI (JavaScript Framework) to ensure website responsive (and mobile first)

 2 Use incremental development

 3 Use BDD (few important tests) and TDD (many unit tests)

 4 Use SOLID OOD (Single-responsiblity principle; Open-closed principle; Liskov substitution principle; Interface segregation principle and Dependency Inversion Principle)

 5 Iterate through user stories


# User Stories

As a User I can view the products and their category, price and availability information
