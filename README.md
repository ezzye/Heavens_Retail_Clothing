# Approach

 1 Use Mobile Angular UI (JavaScript Framework) to ensure website responsive (and mobile first)

 2 Use incremental development

 3 Use BDD (few important tests) and TDD (many unit tests)

 4 Use SOLID OOD (Single-responsiblity principle; Open-closed principle; Liskov substitution principle; Interface segregation principle and Dependency Inversion Principle)

 5 Iterate through user stories


# Discount

Code for Â£5 discount `5PoundDiscount`

# User Stories Completed

2. As a User I can remove a product from my shopping cart.

3. As a User I can view the total price for the products in my shopping cart.
